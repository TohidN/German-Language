In `W Fragen` (W Questions), the verb comes second, after the question word.
E.g. Woher kommen Sie? (Where do you come from?)

In **statements**, the verb again comes in the second position (after the subject).
E.g. Ich komme aus Deutschland. (I come from Germany.)

In **yes/no questions** (Ja/Nein Fragen) the verb comes first.
E.g. Kommen Sie aus Deutschland? (Do you come from Germany?)

A **comma splitting up two clauses** usually makes the following verb go to the end. In German, you need to split up clauses with a comma, but that isn’t always necessary in English. You always need to notice these commas as they’re like signposts—they tell you that the following verb needs to go to the end of the sentence.

Ich habe eine Pizza gegessen, weil ich Hunger hatte. (I ate a pizza because I was hungry.)
