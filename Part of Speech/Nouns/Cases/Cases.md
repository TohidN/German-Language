Cases are applied to [[Nouns]] and [[Pronouns]] changing their relationship.
While in English only pronouns have cases, in German, most words other than verbs have cases. I.e. [[Nouns]], [[Pronouns]], determiners, adjectives, etc..

---
The word order of cases can be changed for emphasis:
> [!example] Example
> Der Mann isst **den Apfel**.
> **Den Apfel** isst der Mann.
