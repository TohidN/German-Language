Notes:
- according to [[Uppercase Rules]], all nouns and those verbs and adjectives which function as nouns should be capitalized.
- All German nouns belong to one of the three [[Grammatical Genders]]: [[Masculine]], [[Feminine]], or [[Neuter]]. E.g. ==Frau== (woman) is feminine, ==Mann== (man) is masculine, and ==Kind== (child) is neuter.
- Nouns can be in Singular or [[Plural Forms]].
