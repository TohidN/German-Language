Modal Verbs come before main verbs and express 6 specific things. 
- ==können== (can) – express ability/talent
- ==müssen== (must) – express forced conditions
- ==dürfen== (may) – permission in legal and personal situations
- ==sollen== (should) – express advice
- ==wollen== (will, wish) – express a strong desire
- ==möchten== (would like) – express a weak desire(usually used to ask for food or coffee)
- ==mögen== (like) – express general likes and dislikes



==möchten== and ==mögen== are partial modal verbs as they don’t require a second verb. However the rest are whole modal verbs and need a second verb.
