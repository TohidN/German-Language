Notes:
- Some verbs have both regular and irregular conjugations that can be used interchangeably.
- The conjugations for ==Sie== (you formal), ==wir== (we) and ==sie== (they) remain the same as the infinitive, and this rule holds true for all verbs in German.
- Irregular verbs can have this stem changes: `a` → `ä`, `e` → `i`, `e` → `ie`
